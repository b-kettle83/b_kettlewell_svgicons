            <h2>A Revolutionizing Beverage</h2>
            <p>Quatro once found success as a fruit flavoured mixture of grapefruit,
                passionfruit, orange, and pineapple, but this success was short lived
                with how limited the options were. In an effort to fix the errors of the
                past, Quatro returned with a more modern and varying brand. </p>
            <p> With more vibrant colours, four additional flavours, and the option 
                to customize your drink with flavour packets, there's no more worry about
                being limited to just one old flavour. Customers still have the option of the
                original mixed flavour, but with each flavour being made into its own drink alongside
                the flavour packets, there are an infinite number of combinations for customers 
                to make to enhance their Quatro experience. These modern and colourfull icons for
                each of the four flavours, the sleek design of the flavour packets, and the 
                new modernized logo and wordmark are symbolic of the fact that Quatro is back, 
                and this time it's here to stay. </p>
